## * CHECK

howdy, names kris. my pronouns are *he/she* and sometimes *they/them*. my preferences change per day, feel free to ask which i prefer at the moment.

**((i'm using this for ponytown, if you want to know more about me specifically, you can check out my rentry that i have linked.))**

♡ i'm usually off-tab while playing ponytown, so unless you see me moving and/or talking, i'm probably not looking at the game. if you want my attention, or just want to say something to me, please *whisper me* and i'll get back to you asap!!

♡ C + H friendly!! i love when people sit with my horse. don't be shy! just keep in mind i may forget to make sure i don't get afk kicked, or i might just close the game at any time. ^_^;

♡ feel free to interact! i love talking to people, but i'm pretty socially inept. if i seem dry, i promise it's not you!
