<p align="center">howdy, names kris. my pronouns are he/she and sometimes they/them. my preferences change per day, feel free to ask which i prefer at the moment.</p>

<p align="center">* i'm usually off-tab while playing ponytown, so unless you see me moving and/or talking, i'm probably not looking at the game. if you want my attention, or just want to say something to me, please whisper me and i'll get back to you asap!!</p>

<p align="center">* C+H friendly!! i love when people sit with my horse. don't be shy! just keep in mind i may forget to make sure i don't get afk kicked, or i might just close the game at any time. ^_^;</i>

<p align="center">* feel free to interact! i love talking to people & making new friends, but i'm pretty socially inept. so if i seem dry, i promise it's not you!</i>
